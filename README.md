## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- The business problem that my project is trying to solve are the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes. The company wants to know which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and how well the variables describe the bike demands.
- The Bike Sharing Dataset of year 2018-19 is used for this project.

## Conclusions
- According to the final model of the given dataset, it is concluded that the variables that are significant in predicting the demand for shared bike are year, month, season, weathersit, humidity, temperature and windspeed.
- Year, month, season and weathersit is the factors that affecting most to the demand for these shared bikes.
- R square of the test model is 0.799.
